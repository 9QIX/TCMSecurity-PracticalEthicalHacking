# Using Virtual Machines (VMs)

## Introduction to Virtual Machines

- Virtual machines (VMs) are machines running on top of another machine.
- They allow creating labs and environments without requiring physical hardware.
- The instructor demonstrates running Windows 10 and Linux VMs on their Windows 10 host machine.

## Benefits of Using VMs

- Avoid the need for dedicated physical hardware for different environments.
- Can be resource-intensive, so a minimum of 16GB RAM is recommended for certain labs (e.g., Active Directory).

## VM Software

- For Windows or Linux: VMware Workstation Player
- Download from: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html
- For macOS: Oracle VirtualBox
- Download from: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

## Installation

- The instructor demonstrates installing VMware Workstation Player and Oracle VirtualBox.
- Step-by-step installation process is shown for both applications.

## Additional Notes

- The instructor uses VMware Workstation Pro but will also utilize the free Workstation Player throughout the course.
- For Active Directory labs, it may be beneficial to use the 30-day trial of VMware Workstation Pro for better functionality.
- However, all demonstrations can be followed using the free Workstation Player.

## Next Steps

- In the next video, the instructor will install Kali Linux on the VMware Workstation Player.

The key takeaway is to have a virtual machine software installed (VMware Workstation Player or Oracle VirtualBox) to follow along with the course labs and exercises effectively.
