# The Five Stages of Ethical Hacking

## Important Note

- This course covers ethical hacking techniques
- Use information for ethical purposes only
- Do not attack without explicit permission

## The Five Stages

1. **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**

   - Passive: Using search engines, social media
   - Active: Directly interacting with target systems

2. **Scanning and Enumeration**

   - Using tools like Nmap, Nexus, Nikto
   - Looking for open ports, vulnerabilities
   - Researching potential exploits

3. **Gaining Access (Exploitation)**

   - Running exploits against vulnerable services
   - Attempting to gain access to systems or networks

4. **Maintaining Access**

   - Ensuring continued access after initial intrusion
   - Repeating scanning and enumeration process

5. **Covering Tracks**
   - Deleting logs, malware, and created accounts
   - Cleaning up all traces of intrusion

## Course Structure

- Focuses heavily on stages 1-3
- Briefly covers stages 4-5
- Methodology remains consistent across different types of assessments
- Includes practice exercises and covers topics like Active Directory, Web Applications, and Wireless

## Key Takeaways

- This methodology is fundamental to ethical hacking
- Tools and methods may change, but the overall process remains the same
- Understanding these stages is important for interviews and professional practice
