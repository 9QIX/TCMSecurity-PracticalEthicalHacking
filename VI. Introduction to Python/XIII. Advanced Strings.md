# Advanced Strings

1. String Indexing and Slicing

   - Access individual characters using indexing (e.g., `my_name[0]`)
   - Use negative indexing to access from the end (e.g., `my_name[-1]`)
   - Slice strings to get substrings (e.g., `sentence[:4]`)

2. String Methods

   - `split()`: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter
   - `join()`: Joins list elements into a string with a specified delimiter
   - `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace

3. Quotes in Strings

   - Use single quotes inside double quotes or vice versa
   - Use backslash (`\`) to escape quotes within the same quote type

4. Case Sensitivity

   - Use `lower()` or `upper()` methods to standardize case for comparisons

5. Checking Substrings

   - Use `in` operator to check if a substring exists in a string

6. String Formatting

   - Use `.format()` method for inserting variables into strings
   - Example: `"My favorite movie is {}.".format(movie)`

7. Other Important Points
   - Python uses zero-based indexing for strings and lists
   - Many string methods are available (e.g., `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`)
   - Always research and look for built-in methods to improve your code

The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding these concepts, especially character escaping and string formatting, as they will be useful in future Python development.
