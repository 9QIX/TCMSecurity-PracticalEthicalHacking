# Python Math Operations

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

- Addition: `print(50 + 50)`
- Subtraction: `print(50 - 50)`
- Multiplication: `print(50 * 50)`
- Division: `print(50 / 50)`

## Complex Operations

- Python follows order of operations (PEMDAS)
- Example: `print(50 + 50 - 50 * 50 / 50)`

## Exponents

- Use `**` for exponents: `print(50 ** 2)`

## Modulo

- Use `%` for modulo (remainder) operations
- Example: `print(50 % 6)` (returns 2)

## Division Types

- Regular division: `print(50 / 6)` (returns float)
- Integer division (no remainder): `print(50 // 6)` (returns integer)

## Additional Notes

- Python has built-in math interpreter
- More advanced math operations available through math modules
- Python can be used as a quick calculator for on-the-fly calculations

## Next Steps

- The next lesson will cover variables and methods

## Important Reminders

- Take good notes
- It's normal to feel overwhelmed at first
- Future lessons will build upon this script
