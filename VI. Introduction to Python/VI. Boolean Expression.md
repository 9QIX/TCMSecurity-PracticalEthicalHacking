# Boolean Expressions in Python

## Introduction

- Boolean expressions are discussed as true or false statements
- Examples are provided using a Python script

## Key Points

1. **Definition**: Boolean expressions are simply true or false statements

2. **Examples**:

   - `bool1 = True`
   - `bool2 = (3 * 3 == 9)`
   - `bool3 = False`
   - `bool4 = (3 * 3 != 9)`

3. **Printing and Type Checking**:

   - The script prints the values of these boolean expressions
   - It also prints their types using `type()`

4. **Important Note**:

   - There's a difference between `True` (boolean) and `"True"` (string)

5. **Usage**:

   - Boolean expressions are used in conditional statements and loops
   - They're essential for control flow in programming

6. **Future Topics**:
   - The video mentions that relational operators will be combined with boolean expressions in future lessons
   - These concepts will be further applied in X-Plane development

## Conclusion

- Understanding boolean expressions is crucial for more advanced programming concepts
- The next video will build upon this knowledge with relational operators
