# Python Tuples

## Key Concepts

- Tuples are immutable data structures in Python
- Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`
- Unlike lists, tuples cannot be changed after creation

## Tuple vs List

- Lists: Mutable (can be changed)
- Tuples: Immutable (cannot be changed)

## Creating a Tuple

```python
grades = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F')
```

## Accessing Tuple Items

Similar to lists, but with limitations:

```python
print(grades[1])  # Prints 'B'
```

## Important Notes

1. Tuples use parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`
2. Methods like `append()` or `pop()` cannot be used on tuples
3. Tuples are useful for representing fixed sets of data

## Usage in the Course

The instructor mentions that this is the last time tuples will be covered in the course, but emphasizes the importance of understanding the concept and the difference between mutable (lists) and immutable (tuples) data structures in Python.
