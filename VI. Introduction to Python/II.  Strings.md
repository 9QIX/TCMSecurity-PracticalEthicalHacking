# Introduction to Python Strings

## Setting Up

1. Create a new directory called `python`
2. Create a new file `first.py`

## Shebang

- Add shebang at the top: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Allows running script with `./first.py` instead of `python3 first.py`

## Printing Strings

1. Basic print: `print("Hello World")`
2. Single vs double quotes: Both work for strings
3. Multi-line strings: Use triple quotes
   ```python
   print("""This string runs
   multiple lines""")
   ```
4. String concatenation:
   ```python
   print("This string is " + "awesome")
   ```

## Running the Script

- Run with `python3 first.py`
- Add `&` at the end to keep terminal access

## New Line Character

- Use `\n` for new lines: `print("Hello\nWorld")`

## Comments

- Use `#` for single-line comments
- Add comments to explain different string types and operations

## Next Steps

- The next lesson will cover math operations in Python
