# Passive Reconnaissance in Ethical Hacking

## Types of Passive Recon

### Physical/Social Reconnaissance

- Location information
  - Satellite images
  - Drone reconnaissance
- Job information
  - Employee details (name, job title, phone number, manager)
  - Badge photos
  - Desk and computer photos

### Web and Host Reconnaissance

1. **Target Validation**

   - Ensure correct target (IP address or website)
   - Avoid accidental attacks on wrong targets

2. **Web Reconnaissance**

   - Subdomain enumeration
     - Tools: Nmap, Sublist3r, etc.
   - Fingerprinting
     - Identify web servers, services, versions

3. **Host Reconnaissance**

   - Identify open ports
   - Determine services and versions

4. **Data Breaches**
   - Crucial for external assessments
   - Leverage leaked credentials from past breaches
   - Examples: Home Depot, Equifax, LinkedIn

## Importance of Information Gathering

- Foundation for successful hacking/penetration testing
- Often more effective than finding and exploiting vulnerabilities directly

## Course Focus

- Emphasis on web and host reconnaissance
- Will cover both passive and bordering-on-active techniques
- In-depth exploration of data breaches and their significance

## Next Steps

- Identifying a specific target for practice
- Exploring data breaches in detail
- Introducing and using various reconnaissance tools
