# IP Addresses

### Video Preface

- Rain noise in the background; apologies in advance.
- Topic: IP Addresses.

### Introduction to IP Addresses

- Common knowledge in IT.
- Focus: deeper theory, types, protocols, and design.

### Demonstration with Kali Terminal

- Command used: `ifconfig`.
- Comparison: `ifconfig` in Linux vs. `ipconfig` in Windows.
- Display of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
  - IPv4: decimal notation.
  - IPv6: hexadecimal notation.

### IP Address Formats

- IPv4: Decimal notation.
- IPv6: Hexadecimal notation.
- IPv4: 32 bits, divided into four 8-bit sections (octets).
- Example: Binary representation of IPv4 addresses.

### Importance of IPv4

- Most common format.
- Discusses bit structure and binary representation.
- Calculation: Sum of bit values to form decimal numbers.

### Limitations of IPv4

- Total possible IPv4 addresses: around 4 billion.
- Insufficient for the global population and device count.
- Historical context: IPv4 since 1981.

### Transition to IPv6

- IPv6: 128-bit addresses.
- Enormous address space compared to IPv4.
- Current usage: Still predominantly IPv4 despite IPv6 availability.

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

- Concept: Allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
- Private IP ranges: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x.

### Private IP Address Ranges

- Class A, B, C: Key private IP ranges.
- Common use:
  - Class C (e.g., 192.168.x.x): Small businesses, households.
  - Class A (e.g., 10.x.x.x): Large businesses, extensive networks.

### Conclusion

- Recap: Understanding IP addressing, the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, and the role of NAT.
- Upcoming topics: OSI model, subnetting, hands-on examples.
