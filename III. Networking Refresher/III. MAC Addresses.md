# MAC Addresses

## Layer 2 Networking Overview

### Focus on Layer 2

- Focus on Layer 2 in networking.
- Layer 3 involves IP addresses and routing.
- Layer 2 involves MAC addresses (physical addresses).

### Understanding MAC Addresses

- MAC stands for Media Access Control.
- Identified in configurations (e.g., IRF config).

### Role of MAC Addresses

- Used for communication over switches.
- Devices (e.g., computers, network interface cards, cell phones) have MAC addresses.
- Crucial for device identification in switching.

### MAC Address Structure

- Consists of six pairs of two hexadecimal digits.
- First three pairs can identify the manufacturer (e.g., VMware).

### Practical Use of MAC Addresses

- Identifying devices within a network.
- Useful when IP addresses aren't enough for identification.
- Helps in identifying the vendor of a device via online lookup.

### Layer 2 and Layer 3 Devices

- Home routers can function as both Layer 2 (switching) and Layer 3 (routing) devices.
- Knowing MAC addresses helps in managing and identifying network devices.

## Key Takeaways

- MAC addresses are essential for Layer 2 switching.
- Important for identifying and managing network devices.
- Repeated emphasis on the importance of MAC addresses in Layer 2.
